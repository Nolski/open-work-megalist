The AI Model Share Project acts as a lab for machine learning innovation at Columbia University.
The project is currently piloting the AI Model Share Platform (see https://modelshare.org) throughout 2021-2022 at Columbia. 
Its mission is to generate the tools needed to assist students, faculty, and the wider data science community to bring machine learning innovations to all manner of end-users.
