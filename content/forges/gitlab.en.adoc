:toc:

GitLab is the largest and most fully featured git hosting platform. It has both an "enterprise" and "community" version.

== What do they do?

GitLab provides a service similar to GitHub via https://gitlab.com.
However, because the "community" version is open source, you can host an instance yourself as well.

== Why might this be important to me?

You have many options for hosting git repositories. GitLab is the most popular *open source* version.

== Considerations to make

GitLab differentiates itself from smaller platforms like Gitea by providing features like static webpage hosting and continuous integration support.
