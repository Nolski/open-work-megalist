:toc:

Gitea is a painless self-hosted Git service. It is similar to GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitLab. Gitea is a fork of Gogs. See the https://blog.gitea.io/2016/12/welcome-to-gitea/[Gitea Announcement blog post] to read about the justification for a fork.

== What do they do?

Maintain the code hosting project Gitea.

== Why might this be important to me?

You have many options for hosting git repositories. Gitea is considered the *easiest* self-hosted choice. 

== Considerations to make

Gitea is *only* self-hosted so if you're looking for a service where you do not have to maintain a webserver, this is not the choice for you.
