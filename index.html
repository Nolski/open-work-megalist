What is CI and why does it matter? 1.1. Tests vs. CI 1.2. Benefits   2. CI platforms 3. Tips and tricks 4. Examples 5. Other resources   This guide is an introduction to Continuous Integration (C.I.) for Open Source projects. In this guide, you will learn about the following topics:\n 1. What is CI and why does it matter? Continuous Integration can be a few different things. However, for the open source context, think of CI as the tool or platform which runs a code test suite. A CI platform will run an open source project’s code test suite and report the test results back in real-time. You can even get this feedback before adding new code into a project.\n 1.1. Tests vs. CI It is important to distinguish code test suites from CI platforms.\n A code test suite usually means the actual tests themselves. The tests might use a framework like Pytest, Google Test, go test, Mocha, RSpec, or one of countless others. When the test suite is run, it provides some kind of guarantee that the code shipped works as designed and as it should.\n CI platforms can be simple or complex. At their simplest, they are \u0026#34;wrappers\u0026#34; for the code test suite. A CI job sets up the infrastructure and environment needed for the software, and then runs the code test suite.\n So, in a way, a CI platform is a tool to automate running your code test suite and allows you to integrate test results into the development process.\n  1.2. Benefits Using a CI platform provides benefits both for agile software development and open source.\n For agile software development, a CI platform enables developers to get real-time feedback about whether new changes are compatible with existing code in the project. Before code gets added, a developer gets a green flag or a red flag for the results of the test suite. Developers will be able to avoid common human errors and mistakes in their code before they are added.\n The open source view is both practical and also psychological:\n  Practical: New contributors or team members can use a test suite to avoid making common mistakes while learning a new codebase.\n  Psychological: Open source contributors are more confident to make changes because there is a safety net, in case there are unexpected side effects from their changes.\n   The practical benefits apply equally to your core team members and outside contributors. In a Pull Request, a CI platform will post the test results into the Pull Request. A developer or core team member will know immediately whether the test suite is still working, or if their changes may have introduced new bugs.\n The psychological benefits are more focused towards anyone (new team members or outside contributors) who are still new to the project. It is difficult for someone to step up and decide to contribute to an open source project! A test suite and CI platform makes it easier by letting a new contributor be bold in making new changes, provided the test suite still passes at the end. The contributor can run the test suite locally before they propose their changes to the project.\n    2. CI platforms There are many different CI platforms available. Which one is best for you depends on your specific needs, what features are available, and what kinds of third-party integrations you need. This guide will not cover them all, but here are some of the most popular ones:\n   Circle CI\n  GitHub Actions\n  GitLab CI\n  Jenkins (powerful, but notoriously difficult to set up)\n  Semaphore\n   Note many of these platforms have no-cost plans for software released under open source licenses. However, usually you will have to pay if using CI on a private or hidden repository. Additionally, all of these platforms have extensive documentation. Read up on their docs to learn more!\n   3. Tips and tricks This is a short list of tips, tricks, and common traps to avoid when integrating CI into your project:\n  All changes should be Pull Requests: To get the most benefit out of a CI tool, all changes to your codebase should be made via a Pull Request. No committing directly to master or production!\n  Use caching for faster builds: All CI platforms usually have some kind of caching feature, if configured. Especially for larger projects, this can lead to huge speed-ups with how long your test suite takes to run.\n  Block new changes from merging if tests fail: If your test suite reports back with errors, do not add the proposed code into the main codebase. Fix the code for the tests first, and then add the changes. If you must make a one-time exception, do not delay in fixing your tests as soon as possible. Otherwise, developers might ignore them altogether (even for valid tests).\n  Keep writing tests: As long as you are writing new code, you should also be writing new tests. Remember, the benefits of CI will not be realized if you are not consistently testing your code.\n     4. Examples Need some examples of projects using a Continuous Integration pipeline? Check out some of the examples below!\n   (Go) proton-bridge: git repo, GitLab CI config, golang-ci config\n  (JavaScript) React: git repo CircleCI config\n  (JavaScript) jest: git repo GitHub Action config\n  (Rust) Conduit: git repo GitLab CI config\n     5.

What is Fedora? 1.1. Linux kernel distribution 1.2. Project 1.3. Community   2. Background 3. Get involved with Fedora      \u0026#34;Fedora\u0026#34; is not only a kind of hat, but also a large Open Source community with a unique role in the Open Source ecosystem. This page provides an overview of the Fedora Linux distribution, project, and community.\n 1. What is Fedora? Fedora is three different things, rolled into one.\n 1.1. Linux kernel distribution Fedora is a Linux kernel distribution. The Linux kernel is just one part of a computer system. To make Linux useful, you need to combine it with other software and an interface that someone can use for a purpose. Fedora is a Linux distribution, just like many others (Debian, Ubuntu, Arch Linux, CentOS/RHEL, etc.).\n  1.2. Project Fedora is a project. Fedora provides a Free and Open Source software platform for innovative technology. New technologies can be explored and tested in ways that few other projects can offer. This way, Fedora becomes a platform for collaboration on user-focused solutions built on that platform. Successful implementations of technology in Fedora often result in wide-spread adoption through downstream projects, like Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), CentOS, and many other Linux distributions.\n The one-liner often used to describe Fedora is below:\n  In plain English, we make an operating system and we make it easy for you do useful stuff with it.\n  — Fedora\u0026#39;s Mission and Foundations    1.3. Community Fedora is a community. Not just any community, but a global community spanning multiple continents. Fedora places strong value in its community. Fedora contributors are not just contributors, but people with their own lives and stories. People involved with Fedora tend to be passionate about what they do and the people they collaborate with.\n    2. Background For additional background about the Fedora Project, see its Wikipedia page.\n  The Fedora Project is an independent project to co-ordinate the development of Fedora Linux, a Linux kernel-based operating system, operating with the vision of \u0026#34;a world where everyone benefits from free and open source software built by inclusive, welcoming, and open-minded communities.\u0026#34; The project’s mission statement is to create \u0026#34;an innovative platform for hardware, clouds, and containers that enables software developers and community members to build tailored solutions for their users\u0026#34;. The project also oversees Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux, a special interest group which maintains the eponymous packages. The project was founded in 2003 as a result of a merger between the Red Hat Linux (RHL) and Fedora Linux projects. It is sponsored by Red Hat primarily, but its employees make up only 35% of project contributors, and most of the over 2,000 contributors are unaffiliated members of the community.\n  — Wikipedia contributors CC BY-SA 3.0     3. Get involved with Fedora Fedora has a team of people to help newcomers get involved with Fedora, known as the Fedora Join Special Interest Group. This is the best way to explore participation in Fedora and see what options there are out there.\n If you are a UNICEF Innovation Fund company, reach out to your Open Source Mentor for extra guidance in an Open Source check-in call.\n   </p>",url:"https://nolski.github.io/open-work-megalist/reference-tracking/fedora/"},{value:"Identity Management",label:"<p></p>",url:"https://nolski.github.io/open-work-megalist/identity/"},{value:"Intro to Creative Commons licenses",label:"<p>Table of Contents 1. What are Creative Commons licenses? 2. Acceptable licenses for UNICEF Venture Fund 3. Free Cultural Works 3.1. Why does UNICEF prefer Free Culture licenses?   4. Resources   1. What are Creative Commons licenses? The Creative Commons licenses are a family of licenses meant for \u0026#34;open\u0026#34; content. The licenses are maintained by the Creative Commons, \u0026#34;a nonprofit organization that helps overcome legal obstacles to the sharing of knowledge and creativity to address the world’s pressing challenges.\u0026#34; They provide a legal framework for sharing open-source content with different rules and requirements for reuse and distribution. Collaboration is accelerated when you have a common legal framework for working with open content. Instead of working out complicated legal partner agreements and terms, your content can build off an established family of licenses used by organizations like Wikipedia, YouTube, Vimeo, the Internet Archive, and more.\n These licenses enable collaborative processes and communities to form around content. The content is more likely to be sustainable if it can fit a governance and sharing model that is compatible with an open commons of information. Therefore, the UNICEF Venture Fund recognizes a subset of the Creative Commons licenses as valid open licenses for contractual agreements with the Venture Fund.\n This is one way the support model for the Venture Fund enables two-way growth even with zero-equity funding. The UNICEF Venture Fund provides early-stage seed funding and mentorship programmes to support start-up companies from UNICEF programme countries build an open strategy for their work. The start-up company benefits from the funding and lived experience shared by the Venture Fund. UNICEF benefits by furthering our mission for every child to have legally-acceptable content that can be used and reused across the diverse range of areas where UNICEF works, in our Country Offices (C.O.s).\n   2. Acceptable licenses for UNICEF Venture Fund The UNICEF Venture Fund recognizes the following licenses as acceptable as open licenses for investments:\n   CC BY 4.0 (Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International) (preferred)\n  CC BY-SA 4.0 (Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International) (preferred)\n  CC BY-NC 4.0 (Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International)\n  CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 (Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International)\n  CC0 (“No Rights Reserved”, or Public Domain Dedication)\n     3. Free Cultural Works The UNICEF Venture Fund prefers licenses compliant with the Free Cultural Works definition. Only two Creative Commons license variants are considered as compatible with Free Cultural Works:\n   CC BY 4.0 (Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International)\n  CC BY-SA 4.0 (Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International)\n  CC0 (“No Rights Reserved”, or Public Domain Dedication)\n   These are considered compatible with Free Cultural Works, because they do not restrict any of the essential freedoms. There are four essential freedoms defined in the Free Cultural Works definition:\n    The freedom to use and perform the work: The licensee must be allowed to make any use, private or public, of the work. For kinds of works where it is relevant, this freedom should include all derived uses (\u0026#34;related rights\u0026#34;) such as performing or interpreting the work. There must be no exception regarding, for example, political or religious considerations.\n  The freedom to study the work and apply the information: The licensee must be allowed to examine the work and to use the knowledge gained from the work in any way. The license may not, for example, restrict \u0026#34;reverse engineering\u0026#34;.\n  The freedom to redistribute copies: Copies may be sold, swapped or given away for free, as part of a larger work, a collection, or independently. There must be no limit on the amount of information that can be copied. There must also not be any limit on who can copy the information or on where the information can be copied.\n  The freedom to distribute derivative works: In order to give everyone the ability to improve upon a work, the license must not limit the freedom to distribute a modified version (or, for physical works, a work somehow derived from the original), regardless of the intent and purpose of such modifications. However, some restrictions may be applied to protect these essential freedoms or the attribution of authors.\n    — Free Cultural Works definition freedomdefined.org/Definition   The following licenses are not considered compatible with Free Cultural Works:\n   CC BY-NC 4.0 (Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International)\n  CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 (Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International)\n  CC BY-ND 4.0 (Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International)\n  CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 (Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0)\n   Additionally, the \u0026#34;NoDerivatives\u0026#34; license variants are not recognized as open licenses by the UNICEF Venture Fund.\n 3.1. Why does UNICEF prefer Free Culture licenses? The UNICEF Venture Fund prefers licenses compatible with the Free Cultural Works definition because they give us the best assurance to use licensed content in a way that enables us to be innovative and creative in the many contexts and environments where UNICEF works. Reusing and improving common content created by others frees up constrained creative resources to solve other pressing challenges towards our mission for every child. They also enable opportunities for collaboration and teamwork on building resources and content together, with both internal UNICEF colleagues and external partners.\n    4.
