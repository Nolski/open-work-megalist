What do they do? 2. Why might this be important to me? 3. Considerations to make GitHub is by far the most popular code hosting website on the internet. It is owned by Microsoft and used by millions.
1. What do they do? Provide a software-as-a-service platform that allows you to host code using the version control system &amp;#34;git&amp;#34;.

What do they do? 2. Why might this be important to me? 3. Considerations to make Jupyter includes a number of smaller projects
JupyterLab is the latest web-based interactive development environment for notebooks, code, and data. Its flexible interface allows users to configure and arrange workflows in data science, scientific computing, computational journalism, and machine learning. A modular design invites extensions to expand and enrich functionality.</description></item></channel></rss>
